The following folder containes a set of helper scripts to run load tests.


How to run the load test
========================
The load test should be run in the following order:

1. build-test.sh
2. start-test.sh
3. Manual test message from Matrix (test flow Matrix -> RocketChat)
4. send-rc-messages.sh (test flow RocketChat -> Matrix)
5. stop-test.sh
6. clean-test.sh


[config.sh]
============
Obtains and configures common parameters for all scripts, like:
 - number of users in the cluster
 - host test namespace
 - host test user
 - host test room
 - others

[health.sh]
============
This script can be run standalone and it will perform a general health check for:
 - Matrix system.
 - RocketChat system.
 - DevWorkspaces for all users.
 - Kafka brokers for all users.

This health check is also automatically run by:
 > build-test.sh
 > start-test.sh

[build-test.sh]
===============
Uses Camel JBang to build and deploy 4 flows (based on Lab 3): m2k, r2k, k2m, k2r.
Building the flows creates the test images (used later to scale up in all user namespaces).

[start-test.sh]
===============
Script responsible to re-use the test images and deploy them in all available user namespaces.
It essentially deploys the 4 flows in each available user namespace to simulate user load in the cluster.
It does this ensuring all worker nodes can authenticate to the image registry, obtain the flow image and deploy it in any scheduled worker node.

[send-rc-message.sh]
====================
This script tests the RocketChat to Matrix flows.
We only use 1 test user for the load test, making it not possible to trigger all rocketchat webhooks.
For that reason we simulate all users using this script that calls directly each one of the webhooks from all different user namespaces.

[stop-test.sh]
==============
Deletes all deployments from all user namespaces (except the host namespace for testing) to clean the cluster from testing artifacts.

[clean-test.sh]
===============
Uses Camel JBang to clean the 4 flows deployed in the host test namespaces. This ensures all the the artifacts are properly deleted: route,service,pod,deployment, etc.

[ws-fix-failed.sh]
==================
After a cluster is provisioned, it may happen that DevWorkspaces are not in healthy state, and show as "Failed". This script will find them, fix them and start them.

[ws-start-all.sh]
=================
This script starts all DevWorspaces that are not already in "Running" state.
It runs first 'ws-fix-failed.sh' to ensure unhealthy workspaces are recovered.
Then it starts also workspaces in 'Stopped' status.
